
Things to do:

Scheduling side:
Add instance creation code
Add code to create constraints from instances
Add parts for master time sync broadcast


Constraint side:
#Handle size constraints and individual var ranges correctly
Make the interpreter only work on selected constraint problem objects.
Templatize the search engine & hook up to model choices
Figure what to do for branching instructions
Map results back into variable instances
Map results back into scheduling instances
How do we collect multiple solutions?  
   #Create a model container for each possible solution.
   Add a limit for number of solutions to return.
   Maybe make another interpreter to do the mapping for a single selected solution set back to the scheduler
   How do we display solutions in a way that allows the designer to make choices?


Meta:
Add regular real-time tasks, with preemptability and everything
Try the whole thing end-to-end with one bus
Try more buses
