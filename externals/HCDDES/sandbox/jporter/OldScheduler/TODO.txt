TODO:

Hmmm... this is very out of date.

Testing:
2/11/2008 Test on rp_autopilot_mode.scs and rp_landing_mode.scs -- those seem to run 
forever, but they are schedulable.

2/11/2008 Test the release build more thoroughly, and check run time comparisons.

Refinement:
2/11/2008 Proper uncertainty and resolution handling -- processor resolution in 
terms of OS resolution.  Overhead terms in processors and buses.

2/11/2008 Command-line option parser for selection of scheduling model, solver, 
output type, solver parameters, etc...

2/11/2008 Exception handling for input parser -- it's pretty messy right now.

2/11/2008 TTP/C Scheduling model.

Wishlist:
2/11/2008 Timing wrapper -- how long did the run take?

2/12/2008 Global mode change points in scheduling model (as in RP thesis) and
synchronization idioms.

Build/Deployment:
2/11/2008 Add path variables to build for Gecode.

2/11/2008 Make a simple installable package.
