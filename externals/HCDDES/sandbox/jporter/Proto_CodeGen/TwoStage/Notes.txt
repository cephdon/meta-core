Mapping AVR devices from Simulink to ESMoL:
   AVR devices must correspond to something in the control language, like 
   a ZOH block or other data source/sink.

UI-level tools:
   Deployment mapping sheet view.
   Schedule display for deployment.

Model Query:
   Find sending, receiving tasks for a given message.
   Find tasks in a a node.
   Find bus eventually connected to a buschan in a node.
   Find signals for a particular message, and their ordering.
   Find comps invoked by a task, and their ordering.

Language/Semantics:
   Data sources and conditions -> events
   Attach events to data flows or state transitions.
   Error handlers -- highest priority (higher than TT tasks).
   Everything else -- lower priority than TT.
     For low-priority event handlers, we can have untimed (lowest priority)
     or timed/deadline handlers (slightly higher priority).  We have to check 
     schedulability for the timed/deadline handlers under the TT regime.
