4/25/2008 Trying it out -- attempting to deploy to xPC.

* Generated code for xPC and then deployed.
	With the default sample setting (~ .0013) the xPC couldn't keep up.

	Reduced the sample period by a factor of 2, then tried again.  Now the xPC can keep
	up (TET ~ .0019), but dropping the sample rate has seriously influenced the stability
	of the model (according to simulation in the test harness).  We'll need to do some 
	carefully-chosen optimization to reduce the cycles.

	Scope test -- reducing the number of inputs to the target scope didn't help much. The
	TET only changed by a few tens of microseconds.

	Note that this model has no UDP output, no interface to the D/A or DIO, and only constant
	inputs.  We'll need quite a bit more headroom to make this work.  On the other hand,
	the inner control loop is in the model.  On the other other hand, removing that won't
	help, because we'll replace it with accesses to the external controller, which are sure
	to be slower than the current loop.

	Note: the sample rate is currently half--I did not change it back!	

* Removed all scope blocks from the discretized model, and turned off all workspace logging.
	That brought the execution time down by an order of magnitude! :-)  We are now well
	within range of being able to execute the plant model on the xPC target.

4/23/2008 Created test harness model with duplicate of original for cleanup.

* Moved ZOH from input of dynamics to output of controller. OK.
* Tried removing ZOH blocks from Aerodynamic Effects/Vertical Effect Dynamics.
	This introduced a small error difference in the dynamics.  I need to find out who
	 added that, and whether it needs to be there.  Need to talk with Gabe.

	Later thoughts: The ZOH must be part of the inner loop controller.
	 Earlier today, Jim Kapinski suggested that the inner loop should run about
	 an order of magnitude faster than the outer loop.  Making that change leads
	 back to the small error difference seen without the ZOH.  Frankly, it looks exactly
	 identical to the non-ZOH error plot.  The parameter is going to stay there for now.

	For the record: the ZOH values were 1/tau_motor, now they are t_s/tau_motor.
	 That will help later when we need RTW to handle the rate transitions.

* Discretization of stuff:
	Tried replacing the velocity integrator with a discrete integrator in the 6 DOF model.
	 For the most part it follows fairly well, but a few of the states are beginning to 
	 wander in a small way.  The discrete integrator has period t_s/tau_motor.

	One more -- the position integrator has been replaced.  It looks about the same.

	Before going too far, try increasing the sample rate of the integrators just for fun.
	 0.25 * sample rate and 0.1 * sample rate didn't change the result.  Going back to 
	 the original sample rate 't_s/tau_motor'.

	The "wandering" states are the first two Euler velocities, though their integrated
	 Euler positions don't seem to have that problem.

	Added discrete-time theta integrator.  No additional change out to t=50.
	Added discrete-time omega integrator.  Very slight magnitude change in deviating
	 states.
	Added ZOH after the wind input. More oscillation in the other states, but the deviating
	 states are still the same (out to t=50).

	Trying discrete state-space for motor dynamics (using fixed version of discrete model,
	 and global plant integration time parameter).  That is the last element which was
	 introducing continuous states into the plant, so if this works it will be fully discrete.
	 Low level oscillations increased again, but no other issues.

	Trying really long sim ((1/10)*t_s/tau_motor).  No change. Removed the 1/10 factor.
