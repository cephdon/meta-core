Instructions for generating and running the quadrotor model:

1. Set up the hardware:
   a. Windows XP dev machine with GME7/GReAT, Matlab R2008a, Hyperterminal,
      Visual C++ 2005
   b. Linux dev machine with Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, avr cross-compilers, and
      Gumstix OpenEmbedded image (compiled)
   c. Gumstix/Robostix setup -- Cross-connected Gumstix UART 
      (via Robostix break-out) to Atmel AVR UART 0 (I2C connection), 
	  connected power to bypass the regulator so both boards could be 
	  supplied by one wall wart. Installed and removed gumstix packages 
	  per Peter's instructions in the FRODOs directory.  Level converter 
	  used for communication to the xPC.

	  Gumstix was also initialized with freshly built OpenEmbedded image,
	  also per Peter's instructions (in the FRODOs directory).
   d. xPC Simulator - Quatech ESC-100 8-port serial PCI card, PCI ethernet
      (for compatibility with the xPC), and a USB floppy drive for booting
	  the xPC RTOS.

2. Created a design directory (quadrotor) and built models.
   a. Created subdirectories for xPC, CodeGen, ESMoL, and TrueTime.
   b. Copied relevant Simulink models into the subdirectory.
   c. Extracted the plant portion of the model from the master starmac_system
      Simulink model (created starmac_xpc.mdl).
   d. Created Simulink specifications for communications to and from the xPC.
   e. Set Real-Time workshop to target the xPC, and changed solver
      configuration to fixed-step.
   f. Built the xPC model and downloaded it to the xPC target box.

3. ESMoL
   a. From directory Plant/quadrotor/ESMoL - import the Simulink .mdl file.
   b.   ..\..\..\bin\MDL2MGA.exe -L .. ..\starmac_system.mdl starmac_system.mga
   c.   Made a backup copy of the newly imported starmac_system.mga.
   d.   ..\..\..\bin\addTypes.exe starmac_system.mga
   e.   Ignore lots and lots of warnings!
   f. Open the model starmac_system.mga in GME.
   g.   Enabled the autolayout component.
   h.   Opened /Root Folder/Dataflow/starmac_system and ran auto layout.
   i.   Ran auto layout on robo_stix and gum_stix as well (and deeper layers).
   j.   Renamed "Root Folder" to "RootFolder" (just in case).
   k. Problems with data type propagation -- start again!

   a. Created a new model with _only_ the gum_stix and robo_stix blocks.
   b. Used MDL2MGA and addTypes to get an .mga-file.
   c. Fixed type deficiencies in minimal Simulink model.
   d.   Removed all rate transition blocks.
   e.   Explicitly set the sizes and types of the top-level ports.
   f.   Turned on port size & type displays, and refreshed the diagram 
         (^d) to check port consistency.
   g. Importing again -- may have worked this time!  Working on code gen.
   h. Mistake -- gum_stix and robo_stix Simulink blocks must be in the top
      level directory inside the Dataflow folder in order to be processed by
	  SL_CodeGen.exe -- making change in the mga.
   i. Code generation failed due to the Zero-Order Hold blocks -- removing
      them from the model.  Where necessary they were replaced with unity
	  gains.
   j. Note: some of the variables (notably external connections) were cast as
      double.  We'll have to change that for this to work.  All of the gain
	  values are doubles as well.  Looking into that...
   k. Added a patch with Harmon to handle the type for the gain parameters.
      Modified all of the gain parameters in the Simulink model to use the 
	  single data type.  Trying again...
   l. Removed zero-order holds from starmac_system_minimal.  Re-imported the
      model.  Moved gum_stix and robo_stix up a level to the Dataflow folder.
	  Ran addTypes (looks good so far).  Ran SL_CodeGen - missed some params
	  in the Simulink model -- try again.
   m. Set all of the input and output port data types in the whole model to
      single to get rid of double in the parameter calls.  A few more 
	  iterations to fix inferencing problems between ports (set size 
	  explicitly as well as type).
   n. Still a few left -- hit those on Monday!
