==============================================================================
ONLINE MODEL CHECKER FOR BOUNDED LTL (BLTL) PROPERTIES ON TRACES WITH RATIONAL
TIMESTAMPS
==============================================================================


1. BLTL syntax
--------------

The properties that can be stated to use with the tool follow the syntax

  P := R or
       ~P or
       P & P or
       P | P or
       F[T] P or
       G[T] P or
       P U[T] P

  R := A == A or
       A ~= A or
       A < A or
       A <= A or
       A > A or
       A >= A

  A := S + S or
       S - S or
       S * S or
       S / S

  S := <name of a signal ; alphanumeric case-sensitive character string>

  T := <any `double' value>

If no explicit parantheses are provided, usual precedence of operators is
followed. For more details, please refer to the parser (parser.ypp).

2. What does each file in the module do?
----------------------------------------

  lexer.l      :   Lexical analyzer (Flex) for the input BLTL property
  parser.ypp   :   Bison parser for the input BLTL property
  parser.hpp   :   Contains all the useful C++ classes for the parser and the model
                   checker (checker.cpp)
  checker.cpp  :   Contains the core of the model checker
  checker.hpp  :   Contains declarations for all the methods defined in
                   checker.cpp
  interface.cpp:   Contains the interface methods to be used by an external
                   software for using the model checker
  test.cpp     :   Drives a testcase given on command-line

3. How to use?
--------------

  The most general use is to integrate the too with external software. For that,
    >cd $CHECKER
    >make interface
    Then, compile the external software and link with the object files so
    generated (namely, interface.o, checker.o, parser.tab.o)

    Note: interface.cpp may need to be changed depending on the language of the
          external software. Currently, it assumes the external software to use
          the C language.

  For testing purposes, do
    >cd $CHECKER
    >make
    This creates an executable named `checker' in the directory `$CHECKER'. In
    order to run it, one needs two files - 1. property file 2. trace file
