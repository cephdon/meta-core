Make sure the XBee's are paired correctly! They come paired to each other on the same channel.

For the Futaba T9CHP, the settings should be similar/exactly as follows (or just select the quadrotor model).
-All trims zeroed. They interfere with the QR's native stabilization.
-No reverses.
-Throttle Cut is however your intestinal fortitude dictates.
-Aux-Ch should be configured to user liking, just know that you need them.
-Under Parameter>Type, it should be ACROBATIC, the Modul should be PPM, ATL on, AIL-2 Ch6or7
-Trainer should be configured so ALL channels 1-8 display FUNC
**-Basically, just go to the SERVO screen and make sure each switch/stick only modifies a sensible channel.
************DO NOT SELECT A HELICOPTER MODEL IN PARAMETER SCREEN!**********
The helicopter model binds the stick motions to things you don't want. Trust me. Glider is right out.
Remember, acrobatic shall be the model chosen, and the model of choice is Acrobatic. Thou will choose Acrobatic.

****PRE FLIGHT CHECKLIST****
Make sure the Futabab or w/e radio you desire is on FIRST and gets turned off LAST.

The command to turn on the rotors is the same as to kill them. Keep throttle at 0 and push yaw to left or right all the way.
