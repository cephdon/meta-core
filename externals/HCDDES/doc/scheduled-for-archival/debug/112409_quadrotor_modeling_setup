Going through the cleanup steps for the generated FRODO code:

1. Linked quadrotor_demo/build under the gumstix tools tree
   cd ~/gumstix/gumstix-oe/user.collection
   mv packages packages.comms_cap
   ln -s ~/sources/HCDDES/trunk/Plant/quadrotor_demo/build packages

2. Copied Gumstix and Robostix to their proper locations:
   mv build/gumstix-frodo/files/app/app.c build/gumstix-frodo/files/app/app.old.c
   cp quadrotor_demo_src/Gumstix.c build/gumstix-frodo/files/app/app.c
   mv build/robostix-frodo/files/app/app.c build/robostix-frodo/files/app/app.old.c
   cp quadrotor_demo_src/Robostix.c build/robostix-frodo/files/app/app.c

3. Still waiting on the SL_CodeGen part -- creating app_tasks_init for both
   sides.

4. Creating the peripheral table for the robostix.

5. Cleaning up the end of line characters in the generated code.

6. Removed the duplicate message declarations from the robostix app.c.

7. At Gabor's direction, tried the working binaries from this system on the
   other two boxes. Amazingly they worked!

8. Still working with Harmon on the code generation issues:
   + Harmon had me make a change the output port on the inner loop to specify
     the data types.  The generator still crashed.
   + Created a new model without the inner loop, to see if we could generate 
     only the parts for the outer loop.  That crashed as well...
   + Created a new model with only the inner loop.  That crashed due to a UDM
     precision exception.  I'm going through the model now to eliminate any
     constants that are too small (e.g. 1.5e-315 ).  Set them all to zero 
     (only a handful, anyway).

   + It looks like something generated for the inner loop.  I need to look it
     over to see if it makes sense.
