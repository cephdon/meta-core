What have we learned so far?

There are some questions that must be answered in order to get a model up
and running.  These questions are key to automating the bring-up and 
troubleshooting processes.

1. Did the packages compile and install properly?
2. Does the running system conform to the schedule?
3. Does each component move data as expected?
4. Is each component running only as long as expected?
5. Are the data links working (timing, transfer time, values)?
6. Do we get consistent end-to-end data flow?
7. Does each component implement the specified function?
8. Do the composed components implement the specified control function?
9. Does the closed-loop system track properly?


First steps:

What are the run times of the quadrotor dynamics with the different solvers?

ode2 - 3.076 us (leaking @ 72s)
ode3 - 3.437 us (leaking time - over 6 us after 300 s running)
ode4 - 4.154 us (leaking @ 75s - 6 us @ 133 s/7.2 us @ 300 s)
ode5 - 5.641 us (leaking @ 72s - 8 us @ 110 s/11.2 us @ 300 s)
ode8 - 13.52 us (leaking @ 72s - 17.6 us @ 100 s/22.4 us @ 200 s)

The leaking effect occurs whether the controller is running or not.

We also get FIFO overflows as it runs.
