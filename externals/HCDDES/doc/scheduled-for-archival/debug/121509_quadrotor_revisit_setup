1. Getting a good version of the quadrotor model.  

   . Checked out a copy of the original quadrotor models (revision 2327).

   . Started checking input ports to make sure their data types and sizes 
     are specified:

     - top-level input ports (i.e. top level of imported subsystems) should
       have their data type and size explicitly specified.
     - all output ports (i.e. imported subsystems and below) should have their
       data type set to "Inherit: auto".

   . We need to move to revision 2343.  Nicholas and I replaced some very hard
     to follow conditional block structure with a simple embedded matlab block.

   . Unfortunately beneficial changes are interspersed with hacks.  We don't 
     have a clean version of the model with all of the right things.

2. Model cleanup:

   . Started with the latest version of the model, and compared block for block
     from the original (r2327) model.   Bringing changes in from the older 
     model as needed, since the newest one has some fairly large structural
     differences:

     - The new model has hard-coded values for the transfer function blocks.
       Replaced with the original, which used variables whose values were 
       supplied by the mask (inner_loop/lead_motor).
 
     - Double-check the generated value for the gain matrix Mi
       (inner_loop/u_T_u_torque_motor_thrust).  In previous versions it was 0.

     - Set gum_stix/body_to_inertial/inertial_val_and_pos_est sample time 
       to 0.02 (wrong in both models).

     - Replaced the mux_euler embedded matlab block with the version from the
       original (gum_stix/inertial_pos_controller).

     - Restored the ones(3,1) call (gum_stix/inertial_pos_controller) in the
       Embedded Matlab Function.  It had been changed to [1; 1; 1].

     - Kept the new version of sensor fusion (gum_stix/sensor_fusion).
