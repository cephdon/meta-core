0. (Yesterday evening).  We now have a mysterious crash in the processing of
   device objects, probably due to the duplicate relation bug when Stage 1 is
   trying to reduce dependencies to messages.  This was worked around by 
   commenting out the code that copies the ExecInfo relations to the device
   nodes (that's where the crash occurred).  Make sure to put it back after
   fixing the relation bug.

1. Tracking down issues in schedule generation.  For some reason the peripheral
   messages are not generated.  Filed a trac issue, put them into the 
   scheduler file by hand, and moved on.

2. It was dumbness on my part -- one of the channels was not connected in the
   model.  Thanks to Graham for finding that one.
