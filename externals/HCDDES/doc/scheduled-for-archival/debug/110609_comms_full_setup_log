1. Importing into GME.  This went OK, but AddTypes choked on the ones(n,m)
   call in the gain block.  The workaround is to specify those explicitly, but
   it's a little bit tedious.

2. Expressions in the gain block don't work.  I split the gain into the matrix
   part and then another gain to scale it all.  Also used decimal constants
   instead of the rational expressions (don't know if that was necessary).

3. Having trouble with the matrix gains in AddTypes.
