1.  Nicholas helped me replace the sensor fusion details with an Embedded 
      Matlab function.  That should do it.

    + Also set the output port types to "auto" per Harmon's instructions.

2. Persistent variables are not supported -- re-working the model to use a 
      data store variable.

    + Still having some trouble with AddTypes.
    + The Embedded Matlab parser did not like the ones(...) statement in one of
        the expressions, so it was replaced with [1; 1; 1].  That seems to have
        worked.

    + Harmon is working on fixes.

3. Stage1 -- completely unconnected message ports don't fare so well.
 
    + Removed the unused message ports from ReferenceHandler.
    + It looks like we got useful output from Stage1, so we'll proceed.

4. Scheduling -- generated with 1 ms resolution

    + Copied the generated schedule file to a "tweakable" version.
    + Generated a reasonable schedule, except for the starting tick.  Shifting
        the whole schedule back by 1 tick should fix that.

5. Back to SL_CodeGen:  

    + Modified the model to avoid cell indexing, and commented out the type
       mismatch assertion identified by Harmon.  We'll see how this one goes.

6. Removed the refhandler task to get rid of some errors.  Now we have FRODO
    code.
