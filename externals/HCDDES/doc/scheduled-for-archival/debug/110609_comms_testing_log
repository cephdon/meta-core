1. The outbound serial message has no header byte, so temporarily we're adding
   a header field to the serial messages in order to handle that.  This should
   be done differently, probably by allocating a bigger transfer buffer for the
   double-buffering.  It could be given a generic char array type, with one 
   more byte for the header.

2. The gumstix seems to be receiving the correct values on the I2C, but sending
   back zeros.  app_tasks_init was never called by the gumstix-frodo setup, so
   the OuterLoop_init function was not invoked to set the gain value.  We fixed
   that by hand.

3. It seems to be working!
