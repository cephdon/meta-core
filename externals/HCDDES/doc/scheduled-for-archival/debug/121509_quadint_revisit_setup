1. Quad Integrator generation and setup:

   . Generated everything from the qint.mga model.

   . Copied the QuadIntegrator tree over to Plant for experimentation (we're
     using a modified version of the Simulink and GME models).

   . Updated the Makefiles appropriately, and ran dos2unix.

   . Missing \ in gumstix-frodo.bb (after last file entry). 

   . No context was generated for the DataHandler -- it should generate an
     empty one.

   . An extra memset was created by the FRODO template.  Easy fix.

2. (Next day) Regenerated.

   . Problem with component name mismatch.  Fixed in stage2 and regenerated.

   . Problem with slot 1 in the schedule -- we need to explicitly model the
     sync message.  Should we even have the ADC?  In the model, the input msg
     was connected to the wrong peripheral.  Not good.

   . Fixed the model and regenerated everything.

   . Almost running right out of the box.  Since the input messages were not
     fully connected, the vel_err field was not generated correctly for the
     angle ref message.  This will be addressed by the constraints, but it's
     annoying for now :-(

3. It appears to be up and running.  Now the xPC is giving us some grief, but
   that's to be expected.
