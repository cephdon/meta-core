1. Trying to get data through the system.
   
   + Put the output tap into place (one floating point word from each point
     on the robostix).

2. Fixed the data handler -- the outer loop copy of the data was not being
   copied in the code.

3. Trying to find the NaN bug in the Outer loop code.  

   + The inertial pos controller input filter had the wrong coefficients 
     (Ts = 0.01 instead of 0.02) -- replaced the coefficients.
 
   + It looks like several of these were wrong in the model -- we'll have
     to try to re-generate the code and see what we get.

      + AddTypes is not working:
      +   the Mi matrix is still all zero
      +   SL_codegen complains that addtypes has not been run.

   + We'll have to make the changes by hand...
