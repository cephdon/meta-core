Notes for 26 May 2010

1. The symptom is zero-data from the reference handler.  

   One bug was the failure to increment the counter, which doesn't account for
   the symptom.

   Was the reference handler compiled into the executable? Yes.

   Is there something else that could be stepping on that data? No.
   The pass-through data was read from the wrong message.

   That seems OK.

2. The system is unstable.  

   All of the comms seem to be doing the right thing, but the trajectories are
   going quickly out into the weeds.
