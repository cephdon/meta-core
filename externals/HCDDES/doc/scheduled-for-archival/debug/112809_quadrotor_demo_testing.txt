1.  The torque converter generated a zero matrix.  This is an effect of the
    mask initialization bug that Harmon already fixed, but we had to port
    the coefficients into the code by hand.

2.  There were two other zero constants that had to be handled in the same
    way.  They are the gains from the euler controller (inner loop).


3. With actual input data (thrust to plant), the xPC is no longer keeping 
   up.  Looking at alternatives...

   + Turned on all of the optimizations available in Real-Time Workshop.
   
   + Ran all weekend with data only (signal generators - no dynamics).
