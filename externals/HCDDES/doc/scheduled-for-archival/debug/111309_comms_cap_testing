1. Loaded the xPC model and the new code.  The I2C successfully sends the 
   sync byte (so it appears), and then everything locks up shortly after that.

   + Try commenting out the I2C messages to see what we get on the line.  The
     expectation is that the local data handling will provide at least an 
     attenuated copy of the output back out (so far we haven't seen anything
     out on the serial line, only inbound).  We're also only seeing the 9-word
     IMU message in.  The GPS message is not being sent.

   + Restructuring the model to send one giant message with all 15 words. 
     This is the worst-case test.
     Changed the union buffer to a big struct containing both messages.
     Set the peripheral pointers to point to those fields.
     Reverted the UART code, and added a single buffer length parameter.

   + We're going to try live debugging with the AVR dragon.  No gumstix, so no
     I2C messages. I need to build a JTAG connector.  We'll see how this goes...
