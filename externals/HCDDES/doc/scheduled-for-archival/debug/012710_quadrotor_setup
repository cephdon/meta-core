0. Starting with a cleaned up quadrotor_demo.mdl.

1. Added ReferenceHandler to the design in quadrotor_demo.mga, along with its
   execution information.

2. Removed the old types from quadrotor_demo.mga, just to be safe (there were
   still several references to the old fixed-point structures).

3. Imported the new model into the design and connected the component 
   definitions to the dataflow.

4. addTypes... make sure we have the latest build first...
