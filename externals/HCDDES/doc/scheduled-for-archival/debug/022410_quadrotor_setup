-1. Check the last quad integrator code into svn.

0. Get the generated code from svn.

1. Modified the scripts, Makefiles, and bitbake to reflect the new source structure.

2. Several files were missing - we had to go back and re-generate. Trying again.

3. Updated with the latest files.  Updated copying scripts.

4. A few more rounds -- the quadrotor_demo_globals.h file contained the 
   definition of quadrotor_demo_STARMAC_gum_stix_sensor_fusion1_LocalVars,
   which no longer matches the original symbol, which was
   quadrotor_demo_STARMAC_gum_stix_sensor_fusion_LocalVars.  Changed it by hand.

5. Missing #include for memset in gumstix-frodo app.c.  Actually, it just 
   needed to have the DOS newlines cleaned out.

6. A constant was wrong in gumstix-frodo.c.  We must have fixed that previously.

7. Sign function was missing in gum_stix_sl.c.  Added a macro.

8. It compiles and runs according to the schedule.  Unfortunately, we don't 
   know if it's doing the right thing.
