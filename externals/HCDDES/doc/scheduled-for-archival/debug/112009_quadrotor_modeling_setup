Procedure for today:

0. Already built the quadrotor xPC model last night, using the comms capacity
   test model and the quadrotor_1 model.

1. Update and rebuild the modeling tools to get all of the latest changes.

2. Restructure the quadrotor model slightly --
   In the robo_stix block, routed Xe and Ve through the sensor_convert block
      (simple pass-through) so that the block could function as the data 
      handler.

   Grouped all of the inner loop control blocks into a single subsystem, and
      removed extra scopes.  Also removed the sector search functions.

   Did the same for the gumstix side.  Also encapsulated the blocks for 
      formatting the input, so we can provide references internally.

3. Import into the comms_test_capacity model using MDL2MGA.

4. Redesigned the message structures to accomodate the new model.

5. Running AddTypes to update the type links.  Forgot to set port sizes 
   on all of the blocks.

   + Updated the Simulink model, re-ran the import, updated the links, and
     trying AddTypes again...

6. Embedded Matlab blocks must also have their port sizes specified manually.

   + Repeating the exercise.

   + Simulink didn't store the port values.  Third time is the charm...

   + Maybe the fourth time :-) The euler angles value needs to be copied into
     two different messages, and the Simulink code won't know how to do that.
     Also, we had to set the input port data types for the ref_data block, as
     the back-propagation of types doesn't work if the input end doesn't have
     a type.
    
   + Fifth time.  The data type conversion blocks needed to have an explicit
     output type specified.

   + #6 Isolated a bug in the multiplexer data type propagation.  Referred to 
     Harmon.

   + It's a very odd corner case.  In a simple model for reproducing the bug, 
     I had to set the type of the output port by hand to MsingleC-1C1M.  Then
     it would recreate the bug.  Removing that reference from my model seems to
     have allowed AddTypes to complete.  Harmon says that I over-specified the
     port types.  The Output ports should be left to the type "auto" whenever
     possible.

7. Quadrotor model design -- 

   + Updated the links within the components.
   + Updated dependencies
   + Updated platform model (single input UART, no ADC)
   + Updated execution/timing model

8. SL_CodeGen did not like the zero order hold blocks, nor the loops in the
   sensor fusion subsystem.

   + Taking a look at the Simulink model to see what we can do about it. 
     Zero-order holds are easy -- they have been moved out of the block.
