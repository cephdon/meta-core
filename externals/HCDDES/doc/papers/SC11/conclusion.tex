\section{Conclusion}

%The current implementation is integrated into the ESMoL tool suite for the Generic Modeling Environment\cite{mic:gme}, but thorough scalability testing requires larger models.  See Porter et al\cite{modeling:esmol_cycles_tr} for an extended account, including a more formal presentation of the method and experimental results.

One interesting observation is the generality of the approach.  Algorithm 
\ref{alg:hcycles} very nearly captures a generic procedure for bottom-up incremental syntactic analysis of hierarchical graphical models.  Note that two small contributions may emerge from this observation 1) we have a structure to which we can adapt some other model analysis techniques for incremental operation, if an appropriate component interface can be found for the particular analysis in question, and 2) this approach could lead to a tool for efficiently specifying such analyses, from which we could generate software code to implement the analysis.
