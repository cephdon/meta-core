In the formulations for both multisensor algorithms, the equations for the calculation of the data association probabilities have been put in the same form as for the JPDA, thus allowing previously developed fast JPDA computational techniques to be applicable. The computational complexity of these multisensor algorithms is discussed, and simulation results are presented demonstrating and comparing the performances of these and other multisensor fusion algorithms.},

abstract = {In tracking targets with less-than-unity probability of detection in the presence of false alarms (FAs), data association - deciding which of the received multiple measurements to use to update each track - is crucial. Most algorithms that make a hard decision on the origin of the true measurement begin to fail as the FA rate increases or with low observable (low probability of target detection) maneuvering targets. Instead of using only one measurement among the received ones and discarding the others, an alternative approach is to use all of the validated measurements with different weights (probabilities), known as probabilistic data association (PDA). This paper presents an overview of the PDA technique and its application for different target tracking scenarios. First, it describes the use of the PDA technique for tracking low observable targets with passive sonar measurements. This target motion analysis is an application of the PDA technique, in conjunction with the maximum-likelihood approach, for target motion parameter estimation via a batch procedure. Then, the PDA technique for tracking highly maneuvering targets and for radar resource management is illustrated with recursive state estimation using the interacting multiple model estimator combined with PDA. Finally, a sliding window (which can also expand and contract) parameter estimator using the PDA approach for tracking the state of a maneuvering target using measurements from an electrooptical sensor is presented. &copy; 2004 IEEE.},

This score function is the likelihood ratio: the ratio of the pdf of a measurement having originated from a track, to the pdf of this measurement having a different origin. The likelihood ratio score is derived rigorously starting from the fully Bayesian (hypothesis oriented) MHT, which is shown to be amenable under some (reasonable) assumptions to the track oriented MHT. The latter can be implemented efficiently using multidimensional assignment. The main feature of a likelihood ratio is the fact that it is a (physically) dimensionless quantity and, consequently, can be used for the association of different numbers of measurements and/or measurements of different dimension. The explicit forms of the likelihood ratio are discussed both for the commonly used Kalman tracking filter, as well as for the Interacting Multiple Model estimator. The issues of measurements of different dimension and different coordinate systems are also discussed.},

The NN filter is the most popular and widely used algorithm for target tracking in clutter due to its computational simplicity. The proposed algorithm is derived from establishing probability density functions conditioned on all the possible events related to the NN measurement. The resulting algorithm is different from the existing probabilistic nearest neighbor filter (PNNF) algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and compared with that of the NNF. The proposed algorithm for aerial target tracking in a clutter environment is tested by a series of Monte Carlo simulation runs.

We propose an efficient real-time algorithm that solves the data association problem and is capable of initiating and terminating a varying number of tracks. We take the data-oriented, combinatorial optimization approach to the data association problem but avoid the enumeration of tracks by applying a sampling method called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The MCMC data association algorithm can be viewed as a "deferred logic" method since its decision about forming a track is based on both current and past observations. At the same time, it can be viewed as an approximation to the optimal Bayesian filter. The algorithm shows remarkable performance compared to the greedy algorithm and the multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT) under extreme conditions, such as a large number of targets in a dense environment, low detection probabilities, and high false alarm rates.},

abstract = {We consider cooperative data multicast in a wireless network with the objective to maximize the network lifetime. We present the maximum lifetime accumulative broadcast (MLAB) algorithm that specifies the nodes' order of transmission and transmit power levels. We prove that the solution found by MLAB is optimal but not necessarily unique. The power levels found by the algorithm ensure that the lifetimes of the active relays are the same, causing them to fail simultaneously. For the same battery levels at all the nodes, the optimum transmit powers become the same. The simplicity of the solution is made possible by allowing the nodes that are out of the transmission range of a transmitter to collect the energy of unreliably received overheard signals. As a message is forwarded through the network, nodes will have multiple opportunities to reliably receive the message by collecting energy during each retransmission. We refer to this cooperative strategy as accumulative multicast. Cooperative multicast not only increases the multicast energy-efficiency by allowing for more energy radiated in the network to be collected, but also facilitates load balancing by relaxing the constraint that a relay has to transmit with power sufficient to reach its most disadvantaged child. When the message is to be delivered to all network nodes this cooperative strategy becomes accumulative broadcast (Marie and Yates, 2002). Simulation results demonstrate that cooperative broadcast significantly increased network lifetime compared with conventional broadcast. We also present the distributed MLAB algorithm for accumulative broadcast that determines the transmit power levels locally at the nodes.},

Multiple distributed communication delays as well as multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO) are considered in the modelling algorithm. In addition, the asynchronous sampling mechanisms of distributed sensors are characterized to obtain the actual time delays between sensors and the controller. Due to the characteristics of a network architecture, piecewise constant plant inputs are assumed and discrete-time models of plant and controller dynamics are adopted to analyse the stability and performance of a closed-loop NCS. The analysis result is used to verify the stability and performance of an NCS without considering the impact of multiple time delays in the controller design. In addition, the proposed NCS model is used as a foundation for optimal controller design. The proposed control algorithm utilizes the information of delayed signals and improves the control performance of a control system encountering distributed communication delays.

abstract = {In this paper we study the effect of communication packet losses in the feedback loop of a control system. Our motivation is derived from vehicle control problems where information is communicated via a wireless local area network. For such problems, we consider a simple packet-loss model for the communicated information and note that results for discrete-time linear systems with Markovian jumping parameters can be applied. The goal is to find a controller (if one exists) such that the closed loop is mean square stable for a given packet loss rate. A linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition is developed for the existence of a stabilizing dynamic output feedback controller. This LMI condition is used to study the effect of communication losses on a vehicle following problem. In summary, these results can be used not only to design controllers but also give a 'worst-case' performance specification (in terms of packet-loss rate) for an acceptable communications system.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the control of discrete-time linear systems that posses randomly jumping parameters which can be described by an underlying finite-state Markov chain. It is assumed there are additive Gaussian disturbances to the system input and output. This model can be used to formulate systems that are subject to abrupt changes in their structure and components, due to failures, repairs or changing subsystem interconnections. This class of model can also be used to represent nonlinear systems, jumping between different linearized models as the operating point changes. Because part of the state takes values in a real vector space while the jumping parameter (which is also part of the system state) can only take discrete values, this type of system is sometimes called a 'hybrid system'. The control of hybrid systems has potential applications involving systems requiring fault-tolerant control. Although discrete time Jump Linear Quadratic (JLQ) optimal control problems, with and without Gaussian noise, have been solved in the literature, conditions available to test the existence of steady-state solutions are, unfortunately, very difficult to implement. In this paper, new necessary and sufficient conditions are established in a form that is directly testable, using recursive computations. These new conditions are based upon stochastic stabilizability and detectability properties for discrete time jump linear systems. The importance of this paper is that it makes feasible the use of jump linear quadratic Gaussian control theory for controller design in applications.},

Our approach is to first design the controller using established techniques considering the network transparent, and then to analyze the effect of the network on closed-loop system performance. When implemented, an NCS will consist of multiple independent sensors and actuators competing for access to the network, with no universal clock available to synchronize their actions. Because the nodes act asynchronously, we allow access to the network at anytime but we assume each access occurs before a prescribed deadline, known as the maximum allowable transfer interval. Only one node may access the network at a time. This communication constraint imposed by the network is the main focus of the paper. The performance of the new, TOD protocol and the statically scheduled protocols are examined in simulations of an automotive gas turbine and an unstable batch reactor.},

Two different linear matrix inequality-based conditions allow to check the existence of such a Lyapunov function. The first one is classical while the second is new and uses a slack variable, which makes it useful for design problems. These two conditions are proved to he equivalent for stability analysis. Investigating the static output feedback control problem, we show that the second condition is, in this case, less conservative. The reduction of the conservatism is illustrated by a numerical evaluation.},

The algorithms provide natural generalizations to large-scale networks of simple additive increase/multiplicative decrease schemes, and are shown to be stable about a system optimum characterized by a proportional fairness criterion. Stability is established by showing that, with an appropriate formulation of the overall optimization problem, the network's implicit objective function provides a Lyapunov function for the dynamical system defined by the rate control algorithm. The network's optimization problem may be cast in primal or dual form: this leads naturally to two classes of algorithm, which may be interpreted in terms of either congestion indication feedback signals or explicit rates based on shadow prices. Both classes of algorithm may be generalized to include routing control, and provide natural implementations of proportionally fair pricing.},

abstract = {We examine linear stochastic control systems when there is a communication channel connecting the sensor to the controller. The problem consists of designing the channel encoder and decoder as well as the controller to satisfy some given control objectives. In particular, we examine the role communication has on the classical linear quadratic Gaussian problem. We give conditions under which the classical separation property between estimation and control holds and the certainty equivalent control law is optimal. We then present the sequential rate distortion framework. We present bounds on the achievable performance and show the inherent tradeoffs between control and communication costs. In particular, we show that optimal quadratic cost decomposes into two terms: A full knowledge cost and a sequential rate distortion cost. &copy; 2004 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, the design of controllers that incorporate structural and multiobjective performance requirements is considered. The control structures under study cover nested, chained, hierarchical, delayed interaction and communications, and symmetric systems. Such structures are strongly related to several modern-day and future applications including integrated flight propulsion systems, platoons of vehicles, micro-electro-mechanical systems, networked control, control of networks, production lines and chemical processes. It is shown that the system classes presented have the common feature that all stabilizing controllers can be characterized by convex constraints on the Youla-Kucera parameter. Using this feature, a solution to a general optimal performance problem that incorporates time domain and frequency domain constraints is obtained. A synthesis procedure is provided which at every step yields a feasible controller together with a measure of its performance with respect to the optimal. Convergence to the optimal performance is established. An example of a multinode network congestion control problem is provided that illustrates the effectiveness of the developed methodology. &copy; 2004 IEEE.},

abstract = {We consider ad hoc wireless networks that are configured as Mobile Backbone Networks. A hierarchical network architecture is synthesized, consisting of Access Nets (ANets) and Backbone Nets (BNets). Each ANet is managed by a (dynamically elected) Backbone Node (BN) that is equipped with higher capability (transmission and processing) modules. The BNs are chosen from currently active mobile backbone-capable nodes or are represented by (ground and/or airborne) unmanned vehicles (UVs) that are guided into selected positions. In this paper, we develop and investigate a new joint power controlled medium access control (MAC) algorithm for wireless access nets (ANets). Under our new protocol, the net backbone node instructs the ANet nodes to make power control adjustments while simultaneously allocating to them slots for the requested transmissions of their packets. This algorithm, in contrast to other employed conventional graph-based scheduling algorithms, satisfies the requirement that a minimum signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) is met at all intended receivers. We show our algorithm to lead to a significant increase in the net throughput level by attaining high spatial reuse.},

Among the variety of possible learning techniques, the pocket algorithm has a proper convergence theorem which asserts its optimality. Unfortunately, the original proof ensures the asymptotic achievement of an optimal weight vector only if the inputs in the training set are integer or rational. This limitation is overcome in this paper by introducing a different approach that leads to the general result. Furthermore, a modified version of the learning method considered, called pocket algorithm with ratchet, is shown to obtain an optimal configuration within a finite number of iterations independently of the given training set.},

abstract = {Faults in automated processes will often cause undesired reactions and shut-down of a controlled plant, and the consequences could be damage to technical parts of the plant, to personnel or the environment. Fault-tolerant control combines diagnosis with control methods to handle faults in an intelligent way. The aim is to prevent that simple faults develop into serious failure and hence increase plant availability and reduce the risk of safety hazards. Fault-tolerant control merges several disciplines into a common framework to achieve these goals. The desired features are obtained through on-line fault diagnosis, automatic condition assessment and calculation of appropriate remedial actions to avoid certain consequences of a fault. The envelope of the possible remedial actions is very wide. Sometimes, simple re-tuning can suffice. In other cases, accommodation of the fault could be achieved by replacing a measurement from a faulty sensor by an estimate. In yet other situations, complex reconfiguration or online controller redesign is required. This paper gives an overview of recent tools to analyze and explore structure and other fundamental properties of an automated system such that any inherent redundancy in the controlled process can be fully utilized to maintain availability, even though faults may occur.},

We study the behavior of force reflecting systems under unknown but constant transmission delays, ranging from periods less than the human reaction time to several seconds. Passive transmission procedures guarantee system stability, but wave reflections and spurious dynamics may interfere with normal operation. Using wave variables for the analysis and implementation, and making appropriate design choices, a system with consistent and predictable behavior is constructed. This design methodology aims to create a virtual tool which accounts for the implicit limitations imposed by the delay. These developments also form the basis for extensions to wave-based prediction and application to variable delays, such as those inherent to Internet-based telemanipulation.},

The usual scattering formalism which, in continuous time, guarantees passivity for any constant delay, is extended in several important ways to the discrete domain, in particular to the case where communication between the master and slave robots occurs over a packet-switched network. We first show that passivity can be maintained in the face of varying delay and packet loss but that it depends fundamentally on the mechanism used to handle missing packets. Passivity alone is not sufficient to guarantee good performance. Therefore, we also introduce a novel buffering and interpolation scheme which not only preserves passivity but has been shown through simulation and experiments to improve tracking performance and transparency in a single-degree-of-freedom teleoperator system.},

The LCA described in this paper shows the new lighting system has the potential to achieve environmental benefits in comparison to existing systems. The environmental impacts of the proposed intelligent lighting system are 18 to 344 times smaller than those of the conventional lighting system for the different environmental impact categories considered: acidification, global warming potential, carcinogenicity, non-cancer potential, ecotoxicity, photochemical smog, eutrophication, ozone depletion potential, and fossil fuel depletion.

In this chapter the reader is introduced to the concepts needed for port-based modeling, design and reasoning in order to prepare and motivate for the geometrical formulations of the port-based approach in the remainder of the book. After some general remarks about the modeling process, this is done from a historic perspective, which immediately relates the port concept to its original notation, the bond graph. Bond graph notation is discussed as well as the concept of causality, which allows one to combine physical and computational structure into one notation and provides important feedback on modeling decisions in the tradeoff between conceptual and computational complexity. Several simple examples of its use are presented and the details of many bond graph related transformations and analysis techniques are discussed in a series of appendices: conversion of an IPM into a bond graph, conversion of causal bond graphs into block diagrams, generation of a set of mixed algebraic and differential equations, direct linear analysis, impedance analysis using bond graphs, nonlinear mechanical systems (mechanisms), homogeneous functions and Euler's theorem, homogeneous energy functions, Legendre transformations, co-energy functions, relations for co-energy functions, Legendre transforms in simple thermodynamics, Legendre transforms and causality, Maxwell reciprocity of constitutive relations.

As it is impossible to fit all this material in this short contribution, two examples of the content are given that are more or less self-supporting/independent, viz. the Glossary, which provides a kind of bird's eye view of the material, and the first Appendix that discusses basic model transformations. However, first the most important basis for the work on port-Hamiltonian systems, viz. the generalization of the bond graph representation into generalized bond graphs, is discussed shortly first.

We also propose a method for decentralized information exchange between vehicles. This approach realizes a dynamical system that supplies each vehicle with a common reference to be used for cooperative motion. We prove a separation principle that decomposes formation stability into two components: Stability of the is achieved information flow for the given graph anal stability of an individual vehicle for the given controller. The information flow can thus be rendered highly robust to changes in the graph, enabling tight formation control despite limitations in intervehicle communication capability. &copy; 2004 IEEE.},

In the k-bounded-delay model, between the transmission of a message and its reception, the plant can execute at most k events.

We show that our framework yields an infinite hierarchy of control problems, CC = DCC<sub>0</sub> contains DCC<sub>1</sub> contains DCC<sub>2</sub> contains [midline ellipsis] contains DCUC contains DC where the containments are strict, CC is the set of control problems solvable with a single controller (centralized case) and DCC<sub>k</sub> (respectively, DCUC, DC) is the set of problems solvable with two controllers in a k-bounded-delay network (respectively, in an unbounded-delay network, without communication). The hierarchy is a result of the following property: Controllers which "work" in a given network will also work in a less nondeterministic network. This property does not hold when nonblockingness is introduced. Checking the existence of controllers in the unbounded-delay case or in the case without communication are undecidable problems. However, a related decentralized observation problem with bounded-delay communication is decidable. &copy; 2004 IEEE.},

We introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. We establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. This required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. It turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. A disagreement function is a Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. A distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. We provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory.

abstract = {The problem of digital finite communication bandwidth (DFCB) control has come to the attention of the research community in connection with a growing interest in the development of distributed and/or networked control systems. In these systems, actuators, sensors, and other components are connected via data-rate constrained links such as wireless radio, etc. In this paper, we consider a scalar model of DFCB control that accommodates time-varying data-rate constraints, such as might occur with intermittent network congestion, and asynchronism of sampling and control actuation. Because of the possibly unpredictable fluctuation of the data-rate, we are interested in feedback control designs that will tolerate significantly constrained data-rates on feedback loops, while providing acceptable performance when such data-rate constraints are not in force. In light of a very basic notion of acceptable performance, we show that control designs with different number of quantization levels tolerate constrained data-rates differently. This leads to the conclusion that binary control represents the most robust control quantization under data-rate constraints imposed by time-varying congestion on the feedback communication channel. The advantage margin of binary control is further investigated numerically with and without the sampling-control asynchronism being considered. We show that the advantage margin is more substantial when the sampling-control asynchronism is significant. A design of quantized (binary) feedback with side channel information is proposed, and stability properties are discussed. We conclude the paper by examining performance limitations of our binary coding in the presence of noise. &copy; 2004 IEEE.},

A method for characterizing the constraints and the associated controllers which can be realized in the face of unobservable transitions is presented in this paper. While these are preliminary results, the characterization can be used by the designer to determine which linear constraints can be implemented without change, which constraints need to be transformed, and how those constraints should be transformed.},

abstract = {Given an arbitrary Petri net (PN) structure, which may have uncontrollable and unobservable transitions, the dead-lock prevention procedure presented here determines a set of linear inequalities on the PN markings. When the PN is supervised so that its marking satisfy these inequalities, the supervised net is proved to be deadlock-free for all initial markings that satisfy the supervision constraints. Deadlock-freedom implies that there will always be at least one transition that is enabled in the closed-loop (supervised) system. The method is not guaranteed to ensure liveness, as it can be applied to systems that cannot be made live under any circumstances. However, for controllable and observable PNs, it is shown that, when the method ensures liveness as well, the liveness-ensuring supervisor is least restrictive. Moreover, it is shown that the method is not restrictive even for PNs in which not all transitions can be made live. The procedure allows automated synthesis of the supervisors.},

abstract = {In a conventional bilateral teleoperation, transmission delay over the Internet can potentially cause instability. A wave variable algorithm guarantees teleoperation stability under varying transmission delay at the cost of poor transient performance. Adding a predictor on the master side can reduce this undesirable side effect, but that would require a slave model. An inaccurate slave model used in the predictor as well as variations in transmission delay, both of which are likely under realistic situations, can result in steady-state errors. A direct drift control algorithm is used to drive this error to zero, regardless of the source of the error. A semi-adaptive predictor that can distinguish between free space and a rigid contact environment is used to provide a more accurate force feedback on the master side. A full adaptive predictor is also used that estimates the environmental force using recursive least squares with a forgetting factor. This research presents the experimental results and evaluations of the previously mentioned wave-variable-based methods under a realistic operation environment using a real master and slave. The algorithm proposed is innovative in that it takes advantage of the strengths of several control methods to build a promising bilateral teleoperation setup that can function under varying transmission delay, modeling error, and changing environment. Success could lead to practical applications in various fields, such as space-based remote control, and telesurgery. Copyright &copy; 2006 by ASME.},

Generally, this property is lost under direct discretization. In this work a new methodology which allows preserving continuous-time passivity is presented. This methodology is based on choosing a proper output, which preserves the passivity structure, while keeping the continuous-time energy function. Analytic formulation and numerical examples, both for open and closed loop, are provided in the paper},

abstract = {The problem of passivity analysis finds important applications in many signal processing systems such as digital quantizers, decision feedback equalizers, and digital and analog filters. Equally important is the problem of passification, where a compensator needs to be designed for a given system to become passive. This paper considers these two problems for a large class of systems that involve uncertain parameters, time delays, quantization errors, and unmodeled high-order dynamics. By characterizing these and many other types of uncertainty using a general tool called integral quadratic constraints (IQCs), we present solutions to the problems of robust passivity analysis and robust passification. More specifically, for the analysis problem, we determine if a given uncertain system is passive for all admissible uncertainty satisfying the IQCs. Similarly, for the problem of robust passification, we are concerned with finding a loop transformation such that a particular part of the uncertain signal processing system becomes passive for all admissible uncertainty. The solutions are given in terms of the feasibility of one or more linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be solved efficiently},

For the first time the scattering transformation is applied to NCS in order to guarantee stability in the presence of arbitrarily large constant time delay. This approach, initially derived from network theory and often used in bilateral teleoperation with time delay, requires in its original version all subsystems to be passive. In this paper a stability condition is derived relaxing this restriction such that also non-passive plants can be stabilized. The performance of the proposed approach is superior over two standard approaches, the Smith predictor and PI control in the presence of time delay uncertainties. Experimental validation results are presented},

The proposed approach is based on input-output models of the subsystems and the scattering transformation, well-known from teleoperation systems analysis with time delay. Passivity of the subsystems has been a prerequisite for guaranteed stability in systems using the scattering transformation. In this paper, the approach is extended to non-passive, non-linear subsystems. The main idea is the compensation of the non-passivity of the plant by excess of passivity of the controller and vice-versa. A numerical example demonstrates that even unstable plants can independently of the constant delay be stabilized over the network},

An illustrative simulated example shows the position tracking performance of the system. We conclude the discussion with two questions for future research.},
