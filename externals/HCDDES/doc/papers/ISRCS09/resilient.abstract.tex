%This is about resilient control of cyber physical systems.
Resilient control systems play a special role in the area of 
cyber-physical systems, where the design must address the 
question how complex dynamic plants are to be controlled safely 
and reliably when a control system is under a cyber attack. 
In this paper we describe a control theoretical framework based on 
the concept of passivity for designing a control network which can tolerate, for
instance, denial-of-service attacks on networks
used in the closed loop. In particular, we demonstrate how the {\em
 resilient power junction} structure could be applied, and provide
simulated results.
