\section{Symbolic Analysis}
\label{S:symbolics}

We created a prototype tool which symbolically derives the controller 
expressions using the dynamic model and some user guidance.  We used the
MuPAD symbolic analysis tool available in Matlab \cite{the09:_matlab}.  Our tool follows the 
steps described in section \ref{S:control} in which we highlight some
additional details in regards to our implementation.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  For each leading principal submatrix $-\hermitian\{Q_d\}_k\
  \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times k}$ $k\ \in \{1,\dots,n+p\}$ we formed the
  symbolic determinant expression $|-\hermitian\{Q_d\}_k|$.  Then use
  MuPAD's \verb solve() command to jointly solve for the control
  coefficients $k_i,\ k_{\mathsf{I}}$ subject to the constraint that
  $|-\hermitian\{Q_d\}_k| > 0$.
\item The calculation of $P$ is a bit more involved:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use MuPAD's function \verb linalg::nullspace() to extract the
  nullspace basis set for $g(x)^T$, then  concatenate the resulting
  list of vectors to construct the matrix $g^{\bot}(x)$. 
\item Compute $g^{\dagger}$ using the Moore-Penrose left psuedoinverse
  $g^{\dagger}=(g(x)^T g(x))^{-1} g(x)^T$.
\item Form the matrices $g(x)^{\bot} Q_d$ and 
$g(x)^{\dagger} Q_d$.  The matrix $P_{\nulll}$ comes from the basis vectors for
the null space of $g(x)^{\bot} Q_d$.   Solving $P = -P_{\nulll} (g^{\dagger} Q_d P_{\nulll})^{-1}$ yields the appropriately scaled matrix $P$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
