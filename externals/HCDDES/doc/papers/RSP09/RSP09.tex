\begin{abstract}
   The development of embedded software for high-confidence systems is a challenging task that must be supported by a deep integration of control theoretical and computational aspects. Model-based development of embedded software has been practiced for more than a decade now, but very few integrated approaches have emerged to provide end-to-end support for the process, and integrate platform aspects as well as verification. The paper describes an early version of a model-based prototyping toolchain that provides such support and covers most engineering steps. The toolchain is coupled with a hardware-in-the-loop simulation system, allowing quick experimental evaluation of designs.
