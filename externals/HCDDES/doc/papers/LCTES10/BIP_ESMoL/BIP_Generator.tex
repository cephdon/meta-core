% Generating BIP (BIP model of VM, component, and interaction synthesis)

\section{Generating BIP Models}

\subsection{Dataflow Component Behavior Synthesis}

Describe translation from Simulink models.

\subsection{Interaction Synthesis}

How do we map the design interactions onto the virtual machine models?  Include model of preemption, etc...  Describe the semantics here.

\subsection{Virtual Machine Templates}

Templates for instantiating the communications controller and the task scheduler on a single node.  

Need details for: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Task to scheduler interactions
\item Scheduler to comms controller interactions
\item Environment interactions
\item Comms controller to comms medium interactions
\end{itemize}
