\section{ ESMoL Language Mapping }
\label{section:esmol}

Now to map ESMoL logical architecture models onto this cycle-checking
formal model we use the following rules:

\begin{align}
\mathbf{Subsys} ::=\; & L_{\bar{i},\bar{o}}^{Subsys} \llbracket \mathbf{Dataflow} \rrbracket \nonumber \\
\mathbf{Dataflow} ::=\; & \mathbf{0} \mid x \mid l_D <\bar{x}>\, \mid \mathbf{Subsys} <\bar{x}, \bar{x} > \nonumber \\
 & \mid \mathbf{Dataflow} \parallel \mathbf{Dataflow} \mid (\nu \bar{x}) \, \mathbf{Dataflow} \nonumber \\
\mathbf{MsgType} ::=\; & M_{\bar{e},e_{ext}} \\
\mathbf{SysTypeDef} ::=\; & \mathbf{Subsys} <\bar{i},\bar{o}> \, \mid l_S <x,x> \nonumber \\
 & \mid \mathbf{SysTypeDef} \parallel \mathbf{SysTypeDef} \mid \mathbf{MsgType} <\bar{x},y> \nonumber \\
\mathbf{SysType} ::=\; & L_{\bar{y_i},\bar{y_o}}^{Sys} \llbracket (\nu \bar{x})(\nu \bar{e}) \, \mathbf{SysTypeDef} \rrbracket \nonumber \\
\mathbf{LogicalModel} ::=\; & \mathbf{SysType} <\bar{i},\bar{o}>\, \mid \, l_L <o,i>  \nonumber \\
 & \mid \mathbf{LogicalModel} \parallel \mathbf{LogicalModel} \nonumber
\end{align}

Briefly (from the bottom rule to the top), logical 
models consist of component blocks ($\mathbf{SysType}$) 
whose interface ports connected by edges.  Component 
blocks are specified by Simulink dataflow blocks 
($\mathbf{Dataflow}$) whose interface ports are 
connected either to other Simulink dataflow blocks 
or to fields in message instances. Each message 
instance ($\mathbf{MsgType}$) inside a system component 
type block also has an interface vertex ($y$) which
faces outward, and all other vertices are hidden within 
the component $(\nu \bar{x})(\nu \bar{y}) \mathbf{SysTypeDef}$.  
At the logical architecture model level, data is 
exchanged via messages which aggregate the individual 
dataflow connections within the components.  
$\mathbf{Dataflow}$ blocks are built up from connections 
between functional vertices and between the interfaces 
on composite subsystem blocks ($\mathbf{Subsys}$).  
These each correspond to sorts in the ESMoL term algebra.

Let $i$, $o$, and $e$ be vertex sorts corresponding to input ports, output 
ports, and message elements respectively.  Let $s$, $c$, $f$, and $d$ be
edge sorts (of $l_D$, above) representing signal edges, connectivity edges
(as described above to support the incremental interface), $f$ for Simulink
primitive function blocks, and $d$ for delay blocks.  The $f$ function edge
sorts are n-ary, so each function block can have an arbitrary but finite
number of input and output connections. For $l_S$ define the
sorts (given with their interfaces) $l^{b,b} < o, i >$, $l^{m,b} <e,i>$, 
and $l^{b,m} <o,e>$.  These represent the three different connection types in
a $\mathbf{SysType}$ specification, for connecting between ports of Simulink
blocks (from outputs to inputs) ($l^{b,b}$), from message elements to Simulink 
input ports ($l^{m,b}$), and from Simulink output ports to message elements
($l^{b,m}$).

Finally we give an encoding of terms representing ESMoL models into the more
general hierarchical graph algebra:

\begin{align}
x &= x & \nonumber \\
L_{\bar{i},\bar{o}}^{Subsys} \llbracket \mathbf{Dataflow} \rrbracket <\bar{x},\bar{x}> &= L_{\bar{x}} \llbracket \mathbb{G} \rrbracket < \bar{x} > & \nonumber \\
M_{\bar{e},e_{ext}} \llbracket \rrbracket <\bar{x}, y> &= L_{\bar{x}} \llbracket \mathbb{G} \rrbracket <\bar{x}> & \nonumber \\
L_{\bar{i},\bar{o}}^{Sys} \llbracket (\nu \bar{x})(\nu \bar{e}) \mathbf{SysTypeDef} \rrbracket &=  L_{\bar{y}} \llbracket \mathbb{G} \rrbracket <\bar{x}> & \\
l_D <\bar{x}> &= l <\bar{x}> & \nonumber \\
l_{*} <x,x> &= l <\bar{x}> & \nonumber \\
(\nu \bar{x}) \mathbf{Dataflow} &= (\nu \bar{x}) \mathbb{G} & \nonumber
\end{align}

The encoding assigns the various layers of hierarchy from the
ESMoL component type system to hierarchical designs in the graph.  Edges from
all layers map to (possibly generalized) edges in the new graph, and 
ports map to vertices.

The final piece is the application to finding delay-free loops.  For a given
ESMoL model, simply remove all delay edges (sort elements $d$).  Then invoke the algorithm.  For the results, if a cycle is found in a component we can 
construct a more detailed cycle model by substituting paths from the connectivity edge sort with their more detailed equivalents in the descendants of the component (recursively descending downwards until we run out of cycle elements).  Call this subgraph the \emph{expanded cycle}.  Repeating the cycle enumeration algorithm on these structures should yield the full set of elementary cycles, and still retain considerable efficiency as we are only analyzing cycles with possible subcycles, which can be a relatively small slice of the design graph.
