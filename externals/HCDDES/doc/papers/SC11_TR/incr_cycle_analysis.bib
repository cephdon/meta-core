The communication between the plants and controllers can tolerate time varying delay and data dropouts. In particular, we introduce a power-junction-network, a general class of input-output-wave-variable-network which allows even a single controller (typically designed to control a single plant) to accurately control the output of multiple plants even if the corresponding dynamics of each plant is different. In addition to the power-junction-network we also introduce a passive downsampler (PDS) and passive upsampler (PUS) in order to further reduce networking traffic while maintaining stability and tracking properties. A detailed (soft real-time) set of examples shows the tracking performance of the networked control system.",

This paper describes a novel multi-rate digital-control system which preserves stability and provides robustness to such implementation uncertainties. We present necessary conditions for stability of conic systems interconnected over digital-control-networks which can tolerate networked delays and data-loss. We also compare the performance using simulation results of the proposed architecture to that of a classic-digital-control-implementation applied to controlling position of a single-degree of freedom robotic manipulator.",
