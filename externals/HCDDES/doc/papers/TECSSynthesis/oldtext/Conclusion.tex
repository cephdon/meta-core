\section{Conclusions}

We have discussed a framework which facilitates the consistent integration of analysis and generation tools into a model-based embedded systems design environment.  A multi-stage model translation approach provides a single, consistent view of the design details to each integrated tool.  We have also tried to construct arguments to show that behavioral correctess (in the form of guarantees) is maintained during the various stages of our analysis and generation process (see Table  \ref{tab:consistencyTools}).
