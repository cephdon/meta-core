High-confidence design of embedded systems demands multiple types of analysis in 
order to verify properties of the system design.  Integrating disparate analysis 
tools into a unified tool chain has proven to be problematic due to the difficulty 
of maintaining semantic consistency of the design across the translation both to 
and from the domain of each analysis tool.  Poorly integrated tools and processes 
result in incorrect designs, decreased system performance, and increased design cost.

In this paper we discuss a model-based approach to integrating analysis tools into 
an embedded system design workflow.  Our two-stage modeling language approach provides 
abstraction at both the model design and analysis tool integration points.  Semantic 
consistency when mapping into alternate domains is more easily maintained because the 
first stage (to an abstract intermediate language) contains all semantically relevant 
transformation details, reducing the second stage (generators) to simplified syntax-only 
translations as much as possible.  The transformations explicitly address the consistency 
of both structural and behavioral semantics. We illustrate our supported design flow with 
a simple control design example and discuss the integration of a few particular analysis 
tools.
