\section{Future Work}

A number of exciting possibilities lie ahead:

\begin{itemize}

\item Current work underway in our research group includes a custom modeling language to capture structural design constraints for passive network control system implementations \cite{ncs:mic}.  These constraints could be presented to the user as components are integrated into the software design model.

\item In order to expand the semantics of our virtual machine implementation, we need to consider modeling the virtual machine itself.  The idea is to parameterize the implementation so that adding new execution models is straightforward as the virtual machine capabilities expand.

\item We will continue to expand our integration with verification tools, especially BIP.

\end{itemize}
