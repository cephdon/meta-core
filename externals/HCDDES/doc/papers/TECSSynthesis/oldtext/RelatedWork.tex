\section{Related Work}

A number of projects seek to bring together tools and techniques for embedded control system design:

\begin{itemize}

\item AADL is a modeling language and standard for specifying deployments of control system 
designs in data networks\cite{modeling:aadl_control_systems}.  AADL projects also include 
integration with the Cheddar real-time scheduling tool\cite{sched:aadl_sched}.

\item The Metropolis modeling framework\cite{modeling:metropolis} has similar goals, and 
aims to give designers tools to create verifiable system models.  Metropolis integrates 
with SystemC, the SPIN model-checking tool, and other tools for schedule and timing analysis. 

\item The DECOS toolchain \cite{modeling:decos} combines a number of existing tools (e.g. the 
TTech tools, SCADE from Esterel Technologies, and others) but the hardware platform modeling 
and analysis aspects are not covered. 

\item Topcased\cite{modeling:Topcased} is a large tool integration effort that centers around 
the UML suite of software design languages.

\end{itemize}

Consistency of integrated tools is an issue for all of these efforts. We are creating a modeling 
language to experiment with design decoupling techniques, rapid integration of heterogeneous tools, 
and representation of formal semantics.  Many of the listed projects are too large to allow 
experimentation with the semantics of the entire toolchain, and standardization does not favor 
experimentation with syntax.  Due to its experimental nature some parts of our language and tool 
infrastructure change very frequently.  As functionality expands we may seek integration with 
existing tools as appropriate.
