\section{Related Work}

A number of projects seek to bring together tools and techniques which would be applicable to
CPS design:

\begin{itemize}

\item AADL is a modeling language and standard for specifying deployments of control system 
designs in data networks\cite{modeling:aadl_control_systems}.  AADL also
integrates with the Cheddar real-time scheduling tool\cite{sched:aadl_sched}.

\item The Metropolis modeling framework\cite{modeling:metropolis} has similar goals, and 
aims to give designers tools to create verifiable system models.  Metropolis integrates 
with SystemC, SPIN model-checking, and tools for schedule and timing analysis. 

\item The DECOS toolchain \cite{modeling:decos} combines a number of existing tools (e.g. the 
TTech tools, SCADE from Esterel Technologies, and others) but the hardware platform modeling 
and analysis aspects are not covered.

\item Topcased\cite{tools:Topcased} is a large tool integration effort
centering around UML software design languages and integration of
formal tools.

\item Several independent efforts have used the synchronous language Lustre as a
model translation target (e.g. \cite{modeling:lustre2} and
\cite{modeling:lustre1}).

\item The Timing Definition Language (TDL) is the successor to the Giotto time-triggered
modeling language, and inspired parts of our tool design \cite{timed:tdl} \cite{timed:tdlflexray}.  
TDL does not directly model controller semantics. 

\end{itemize}

Consistency of integrated tools is an issue for all of these efforts. We are creating a modeling 
language to experiment with design decoupling techniques, rapid integration of heterogeneous tools, 
and representation of formal semantics.  Many of the listed projects are too large to allow 
experimentation with the semantics of the entire toolchain, and standardization does not favor 
experimentation with syntax.  Due to its experimental nature some parts of our language and tool 
infrastructure change very frequently.  As functionality expands we may seek integration with 
existing tools as appropriate.
