Cyber-physical systems software is increasingly produced by generation from models.
Integrating disparate tools and generators into a unified tool chain is
problematic due to the difficulty of maintaining semantic consistency of
design artifacts across translations to and from integrated tool domains. Our two-stage transformation 
approach provides abstraction at both the model design and tool integration points.  
Semantic consistency between domains is more easily maintained because the 
first stage (to an abstract intermediate language) contains all semantically relevant 
transformation details, reducing the second stage (generators) to syntax-only 
translations where possible.  We illustrate the design flow with 
a simple control design example.
