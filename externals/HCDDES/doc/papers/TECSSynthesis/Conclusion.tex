\section{Conclusion}

We have seen that even for a few of the design concerns of a cyber-physical system
numerous details must be addressed.  The two-stage model transformation approach 
seems to offer hope for organizing these details.  Still, the first stage 
transformation may be prohibitively complex to maintain or extend.  Our approach 
to control design correctness through passivity and time-triggered execution also
offers hope for constructively verifying designs.  We also hope that extensions to
include asynchronous execution semantics will be well-managed using the constructively
verification approach provided by the BIP formalism.  However, our results showed that
we still have other issues to address before the promise of constructively correct 
model-based design can be realized. We must deal with the effects of quantization 
differences between platforms.   All in all the approach seems sound, and future 
work will address the shortcomings.
