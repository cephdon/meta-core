\section{Related Work: Languages and Tools for Embedded Systems Design}

A number of projects seek to bring together 
tools and techniques which can automate different
aspects of high-confidence distributed control system design and analysis:

\begin{itemize}

\item AADL is a textual language and standard for 
specifying deployments of control system designs in data 
networks\cite{modeling:aadl_control_systems}.  AADL 
projects also include integration with the Cheddar 
scheduling tool\cite{sched:aadl_sched}. Cheddar is 
an extensible analysis framework which includes a 
number of classic real-time scheduling 
algorithms\cite{sched:cheddar}.

\item Giotto\cite{modeling:giotto3} is a modeling 
language for time-triggered tasks running on a single 
processor.  Giotto uses a simple greedy algorithm to 
compute schedules.   The TDL (Timing 
Definition Language) is a successor to Giotto, and 
extends the language and tools with the notion of 
modules (software components)\cite{timed:tdl}.  One version 
of a TDL scheduler determines acceptable communication windows 
in the schedule for all modes, and attempts to assign bus 
messages to those windows\cite{timed:tdlflexray}.

\item The Metropolis modeling framework\cite{modeling:metropolis} 
aims to give designers tools to create verifiable system models.  
Metropolis integrates with SystemC, the SPIN model-checking tool, 
and other tools for schedule and timing analysis. 

\item Topcased\cite{tools:Topcased} is a large tool integration effort
centering around UML software design languages and integration of
formal tools.

\item Several independent efforts have used the synchronous 
language Lustre as a model translation target 
(e.g. \cite{modeling:lustre2} and \cite{modeling:lustre1}) 
for deadlock and timing analysis.

\item RTComposer\cite{modeling:rtcomposer} is a 
modeling, analysis, and runtime framework built on 
automata models.  It aims to provide compositional 
construction of schedulers subject to requirements 
specifications.  Requirements in RTComposer can be 
given as automata or temporal logic specifications.  

\item The DECOS toolchain \cite{modeling:decos} 
combines a number of existing modeling tools (e.g. the 
TTTech tools, SCADE from Esterel Technologies, 
and others) but the hardware platform modeling 
and analysis aspects are not covered.

\end{itemize}

We are creating a modeling language to experiment with design decoupling 
techniques, integration of heterogeneous tools, 
and rapid analysis and deployment.  Many of the 
listed projects are too large to allow 
experimentation with the toolchain structure, and 
standardization does not favor experimentation 
with syntax or semantics.  Due to its experimental nature 
some parts of our language and tool infrastructure 
change very frequently.  As functionality expands we 
may seek integration with existing tools or standards as appropriate.
