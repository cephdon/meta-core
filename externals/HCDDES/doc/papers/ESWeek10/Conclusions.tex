\subsection{Future Work}

For the future, we would like to address a few things to advance the usefulness 
of this technique:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Carefully evaluate numerical calculation effects for the sector analyzer implementation. Determine whether a fixed-point implementation is meaningful.
 \item Empirically study the sensitivity of the sector bounds to data and parameter quantization on actual hardware and using a wider range of test models.
 \item Compare sector results between TrueTime simulations and the actual platform.
 \item Revisit the effects of link delays on the sector values, comparing with models which are more sensitive to delay effects.
 \item Develop the relevant theory and assess the use of the sector analysis for switched and hybrid systems.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusions}

We conclude that online sector analysis is a potentially useful technique for validation of 
passive control systems software.  It seems able to detect quantization and sampling effects
which could violate design assumptions in passive digital control systems. Further investigation 
is required to better characterize its capability with respect to network delays.
