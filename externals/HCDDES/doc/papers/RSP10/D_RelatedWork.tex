Several modeling frameworks for real-time embedded systems development include some variant of simulation and analysis of platform effects.  Both SystemC \cite{grotker_02} and AADL \cite{hf_07} are textual languages for defining both software components and their deployment hardware platform.  Similarly, the Metropolis modeling framework \cite{bwhlps_03} aims to give designers tools to create verifiable system models, and has the ability to simulate software components deployed on a defined hardware platform.  None of these modeling frameworks explicitly support the time-triggered architecture.  Additionally, ESMoL differs from AADL, SystemC, and Metropolis in the basic modeling approach\cite{pkvnhhts_08}.  The DECOS project \cite{hsslhbcllss_07} has many similar goals to ESMoL, but the project no longer appears to be active.

Other embedded system modeling frameworks adhere to a time-triggered architecture, such as SCADE\textbackslash Lustre \cite{ccmstn_03}, Giotto \cite{hhk_01} or its successor the Timing Definition Language (TDL) \cite{ffpt_05}, but tend not to include modeling of the deployment hardware platform.  Without native inclusion of both software and hardware components simulation and analysis of platform effects can be difficult or incomplete.

The BIP \cite{basu_08, bbs_06} tool chain supports modeling of heterogenous embedded systems.  The real-time variant of its runtime engine supports timed execution of components, and is able to simulate platform effects as long as a detailed model of the platform is integrated into the overall model.  The BIP language specification \cite{bipUserManual} has not yet been extended to explicitly include concepts for platform definition.

There are numerous examples of TrueTime being used to simulate platform effects \cite{coh_07,vv_05}.  In all of these examples the models are manually created and details of the hardware platforms are translated into TrueTime blocks by hand.  Additionally, no examples were found where time-triggered communication was employed to provide a more robust distributed control system architecture.
