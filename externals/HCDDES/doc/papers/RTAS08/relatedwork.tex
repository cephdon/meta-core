A number of modeling tools provide similar functionality to the toolchain elements previously described.  We present a few of the more notable examples here with brief descriptions and comparisons.

\textbf{Mathworks' Simulink/Stateflow.} \cite{mathworks:tools} Mathworks tools such as Simulink and Stateflow are integrated into the toolchain, but add-ons are also available from Mathworks that provide code generation and verification.  The Real-Time Workshop add-ons allow flexible code generation for a number of embedded target platforms.   Our toolchain differs in that it provides direct modeling of the distributed platform and computation of time-triggered schedules to execute the code in a deterministic and distributed way.  The Simulink Verification and Validation tools provide links to requirements and tests, as well as test coverage analysis.  This is just one part of the whole verification problem.  More recently, Mathworks has released the Design Verifier tools, but we have not had the opportunity to evaluate them.  From product literature, it appears that the tools focus on model coverage and test generation functionality while providing additional user-definable properties for more general verification.

\textbf{UCB Ptolemy II.} \cite{ucb:ptolemy2} Ptolemy II is a freely available multi-paradigm modeling and design tool that emphasizes the composition of heterogeneous models of computation.   The library of implemented function blocks (actors) and models of computation (directors) is well-developed and covers a number of domains. In particular, Ptolemy implements finite state machines, synchronous data flow, and time-triggered directors, which are all relevant to this research work.  Additionally, Ptolemy has a new code generation mechanism based on partial evaluation \cite{ZhouLeungLee2007} that seems promising, though additional work is needed to expand the library of actors and directors for which code can be generated.

\textbf{Kennedy-Carter xUML Tools.} \cite{kc:xuml} xUML is a commercial UML design tool that emphasizes executable design models.  xUML provides configurable code generation from models as well as links to requirements, use cases, and test descriptions.  In xUML, the notion of system correctness is limited to that provided by defined tests rather than providing formal property checking.
