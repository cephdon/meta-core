\section{Objectives}

This project aims to develop a comprehensive approach to the model-based design of high-confidence distributed embedded systems. We take advantage and fully leverage a shared theoretical foundation and technology infrastructure in four focus areas: hybrid and embedded systems theory, model-based software design, composable tool architectures and experimental testbeds. The objectives of our research in the focus areas are the following:   

\begin{enumerate}

\item Develop theory of deep composition of hybrid systems with attributes of computational and communication platforms. We address compositionality, concurrency, heterogeneity and resource constraints, robustness, approximate verification, and adaptive control architectures for uncertainty handling.

\item Develop foundations of model-based software design for high-confidence, networked embedded systems applications. We investigate new semantic foundations for modeling languages and model transformations, precisely architected software and systems platforms that guarantee system properties via construction, and new methods for static source code verification and testing, as well as for dynamic runtime verification and testing.

\item Develop composable tool architectures that supports high-level reusability of modeling, model analysis, verification, and testing tools in domain-specific tool chains. We create new foundations for tool integration that go beyond data modeling and data transfer.

\item Demonstrate the overall effort by creating an end-to-end design tool chain prototype for model-based generation and verification of embedded controller code for experimental platforms.

\end{enumerate}
