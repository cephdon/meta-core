              programming models, namely, SPMD (Single-Program
              Multiple-Data) programs. We define a formal model
              of SPMD programs based on interleaving threads
              that manipulate global and local arrays, and
              synchronize via barriers. SPMD programs are
              written with the intention to be deterministic,
              although programming errors may result in this not
              being true. SPMD programs are also frequently
              modified toward optimal performance. These facts
              motivate the need for methods to check determinism
              and program equivalence. A key property in
              achieving this is non-interference. We formulate
              non-interference as validity of logical formulas
              automatically derived from the program, we show
              that non-interference implies determinism, and we
              report on a prototype that can prove
              non-interference of NVIDIA CUDA programs.},

In August 2010, the Office of Information Systems and Cyber Security (ISCS) within the Office of the Director, Defense Research and Engineering (DDR\&E) sponsored the Strategic Directions in Software at Scale (SaS) Workshop. The SaS Workshop was hosted by the University of California, Berkeley. The goals of the workshop were to:
 

    * Identify new ideas and promising research directions in software engineering and computer science achievable in the short-, mid-, and long-term.
    * Identify opportunities for collaboration and engage in rich intellectual exchange of technical ideas.
    * Create a foundation for developing a DoD roadmap for SaS.
    * Begin to build a case for increasing DoD investment in software engineering and computer science research to strengthen the DoD’s software technology base.

 

Fifteen invited speakers gave presentations in the areas of software synthesis, robust and continuous behavior, temporal semantics, scalable composition, and software engineering process and methodology. Each speaker advocated a particular technical approach that could be the basis for a “Strategic Direction” in future software research. To capture the quality and promise of the technical approaches, attendees were asked to rate each presentation with respect to six evaluation criteria.
 

The overall best technical approaches, as assessed by the attendees, were "Temporal Semantics in Concurrent and Distributed Software"—Edward Lee, "Is Distributed Consistency Scalable?"—Ken Birman, and "The Effect of Software (and Communication) Reliability and Security on Control Systems"—Bruno Sinopoli.

              requires attention not only to functional behavior
              and correctness, but also to non-functional
              aspects and specifically timing and performance
              constraints. A structured, compositional,
              model-based approach based on stepwise refinement
              and abstraction techniques can support the
              development process, increase its quality and
              reduce development time through automation of
              synthesis, analysis or verification. For this
              purpose, we introduce in this paper a general
              theory of timed actor interfaces. Our theory
              supports a notion of refinement that is based on
              the principle of worst-case design that permeates
              the world of performance-critical systems. This is
              in contrast with the classical behavioral and
              functional refinements based on restricting or
              enlarging sets of behaviors. An important feature
              of our refinement is that it allows
              time-deterministic abstractions to be made of
              time-non-deterministic systems, improving
              efficiency and reducing complexity of formal
              analysis. We also show how our theory relates to,
              and can be used to reconcile a number of existing
              time and performance models and how their
              established theories can be exploited to represent
              and analyze interface specifications and
              refinement steps.},

    abstract = {Complex systems demand diversity in the modeling
              mechanisms. One way to deal with a diversity of
              requirements is to create flexible modeling
              frameworks that can be adapted to cover the field
              of interest. The downside of this approach is a
              weakening of the semantics of the modeling
              frameworks that compromises interoperability,
              understandability, and analyzability of the
              models. An alternative approach is to embrace
              heterogeneity and to provide mechanisms for a
              diversity of models to interact. This paper
              reviews an approach that achieves such interaction
              between diverse models using an abstract
              semantics, which is a deliberately incomplete
              semantics that cannot by itself define a useful
              modeling framework. It instead focuses on the
              interactions between diverse models, reducing the
              nature of those interactions to a minimum that
              achieves a well-defined composition. An example of
              such an abstract semantics is the actor semantics,
              which can handle many heterogeneous models that
              are built today, and some that are not common
              today. The actor abstract semantics and many
              concrete semantics have been implemented in
              Ptolemy II, an open-source software framework
              distributed under a BSD-style license.},

              class-oriented, object-oriented, actor-oriented
              and state-oriented approaches. To facilitate

              new model of computation that we call Ptera

              appropriate for modeling complex discrete-event
              systems. A key capability is that Ptera models

              systems. The focus is on assembly of concurrent
              components. The key underlying principle in the
              project is the use of well-defined models of
              computation that govern the interaction between
              components. A major problem area being addressed
              is the use of heterogeneous mixtures of models of
              computation. Ptolemy II takes a component view of
              design, in that models are constructed as a set of
              interacting components. A model of computation
              governs the semantics of the interaction, and thus
              imposes an execution-time discipline. Ptolemy II
              has implementations of many models of computation

    abstract = {Ptolemy II is an open-source software framework
              supporting experimentation with actor-oriented
              design. Actors are software components that
              execute concurrently and communicate through
              messages sent via interconnected ports. A model is
              a hierarchical interconnection of actors. In
              Ptolemy II, the semantics of a model is not
              determined by the framework, but rather by a
              software component in the model called a director,
              which implements a model of computation. The
              Ptolemy Project has developed directors supporting
              process networks (PN), discrete-events (DE),
              dataflow (SDF), synchronous/reactive(SR),
              rendezvous-based models, 3-D visualization, and
              continuous-time models. Each level of the
              hierarchy in a model can have its own director,
              and distinct directors can be composed
              hierarchically. A major emphasis of the project
              has been on understanding the heterogeneous
              combinations of models of computation realized by
              these directors. Directors can be combined
              hierarchically with state machines to make modal
              models. A hierarchical combination of
              continuous-time models with state machines yields
              hybrid systems ; a combination of
              synchronous/reactive with state machines yields

              SyncCharts).

    abstract = {To be able to analyze and control the joint
              dynamics of software, networks, and physical
              processes, engineers need to be able to analyze
              and control the temporal behavior of software and
              networks. Most real-time systems techniques aim to
              do this by focusing on predicting execution time
              bounds through program analysis and architectural
              modeling. In this talk, I attempt to give a
              rigorous meaning to "prediction" in this context,
              and argue that what engineers need is not
              predictability so much as repeatability. The
              argument relies on the observation that Boolean
              properties (properties that are either satisfied
              or not satisfied) are necessarily properties of
              models and not properties of the physical
              realizations of systems. Predictability is about
              the ability to anticipate whether properties will
              be satisfied, whereas repeatability is about the
              ability of a physical realization to deliver
              consistent behavior.},

We employ static analysis to examine monotonicity of functions defined over lattices in a λ-calculus augmented with constants, branching, meets, joins and recursive definitions. The need for such a verification procedure has recently arisen in our work on a static analyzer generator called Zoo, in which the specification of static analysis (input to Zoo) consists of finite-height lattice definitions and function definitions over the lattices. Once monotonicity of the functions is ascertained, the generated analyzer is guaranteed to terminate. 1},

          abstract = {Discrete-event (DE) models are formal system
                    specifications that have analyzable deterministic
                    behaviors. Using a global, consistent notion of
                    time, DE components communicate via time-stamped
                    events. DE models have primarily been used in
                    performance modeling and simulation, where time
                    stamps are a modeling property bearing no
                    relationship to real time during execution of the
                    model. In this paper, we extend DE models with the
                    capability of relating certain events to physical
                    time. We propose a programming model, called
                    PTIDES (Programming Temporally Integrated
                    Distributed Embedded Systems), which has DE
                    semantics, but with carefully chosen relations
                    between model time and real time. Key to making
                    this model effective is to ensure that constraints
                    that guarantee determinacy in the semantics are
                    preserved at runtime. To accomplish this, we give
                    a distributed execution strategy that obeys DE
                    semantics without the penalty of totally ordered
                    executions based on time stamps. Our technique
                    relies on having a distributed common notion of
                    time, known to some precision. Based on causality
                    analysis of DE models, we define relevant
                    dependency and relevant orders to enable
                    out-of-order execution without compromising
                    determinism and without requiring backtracking.},

    Abstract = {In this dissertation I present my work on a flexible and efficient model transformation technique, which includes a transformation engine and a formal and expressive control language.

I define a basic transformation with a transformation rule, which describes the relationship between input models and the result of the transformation. I invent a syntax for transformation rules, which is close to the modeling language that designers use to create the input models. This makes it convenient for the designers to use the technology. The semantics of transformation rules is defined based on graph transformation theory. To improve flexibility over traditional approaches, I introduce extensions to allow complex transformation rules with variable structures to be specified with compact higher-order descriptions.

A transformation workflow consists of basic transformations controlled in a control language. Existing control languages include finite state machines and dataflow diagrams. Realizing their limitations in expressiveness and efficiency, I create the Ptera (Ptolemy event relationship actor) model of computation based on event graphs. I show that Ptera is an appropriate control language for transformation workflows. It allows transformation tasks to be composed hierarchically. The event queue and the notion of model time enable the scheduling of future tasks. By using a shared variable to represent the model under transformation, the overhead caused by communication with transient data packages is eliminated.

The research has a wide range of practical applications. I demonstrate the power of the idea with examples including model optimization and automatic model construction.}

                  discrete-event (DE) models as program
                  specifications. PTIDES improves on distributed DE
                  execution by allowing more concurrent event

                  discusses the general execution strategy for PTIDES,

                  execution strategy is then extended with tolerance

FSMs are actors whose behavior is described using a finite set of states and transitions between the states. The transitions between the states are enabled by guards, which are boolean-valued expressions that can reference inputs to the actor and parameters in scope. The transitions can produce outputs and can update the value of parameters in scope. Modal models extend FSMs by allowing states to have refinements, which are hierarchical Ptolemy II models. The refinements may themselves be FSMs, modal models, or any composite actor containing a director compatible with the domain in which the modal model is being used. This report describes the operational semantics, the practical usage, and the semantics of time in modal models.}

              specifically addresses description and performance
              analysis of simulators for legacy real-time
              embedded systems. The proposed framework includes
              the original software application as a component
              whose simulation is supervised by an execution
              controller. Simulation of the legacy system is
              achieved by controlling the execution of the
              application code on a host platform, together with
              a legacy platform model, in closed-loop with the
              plant model. The control objective is to simulate
              the behavior of the real time embedded system,
              including the effects of platform artifacts such
              as execution times and scheduling (in particular,

              continuous-time behavior of the plant.},

    day = {1},
    month = {May},
    year = {2011},
    abstract = {All widely used software abstractions lack
              temporal semantics. The notion of correct
              execution of a program written in every
              widely-used programming language today does not
              depend on the temporal behavior of the program.
              But temporal behavior matters in almost all
              systems. Even in systems with no particular
              real-time requirements, timing of programs is
              relevant to the value delivered by programs, and
              in the case of concurrent programs, also affects
              the functionality. In systems with real-time
              requirements, such as most cyber-physical systems,
              temporal behavior affects not just the value
              delivered by a system but also its correctness.
              The lack of temporal semantics in programs has
              many consequences that can undermine confidence in
              systems. For example, without temporal semantics,
              denial-of-service attacks are no threat.
              Typically, a denial-of-service attack only affects
              the timing of services, and if timing is
              irrelevant to correctness, then such an attacks is
              also irrelevant. But we know that such attacks are
              not irrelevant. Worse, without temporal semantics
              in programs, there is no semantic basis for
              distinguishing between normal behavior and
              behavior under attack. Hence, detection of
              denial-of-service attacks is at best a heuristic.
              In this talk, we will argue that time can and must
              become part of the semantics of programs for a
              large class of applications. To illustrate that
              this is both practical and useful, we will
              describe two recent efforts at Berkeley in the
              design and analysis of timing-centric software
              systems. On the design side, we will describe
              PTIDES, a programming model for distributed
              real-time systems. PTIDES rests on a rigorous
              semantics of discrete-event systems and reflects
              the realities in distributed real-time, where
              measuring the passage of time is imperfect. PTIDES
              enables deterministic time-sensitive distributed
              actions. It relies on certain assumptions about
              networks that are not trivial (time
              synchronization with bounded error and bounded
              latency), but which have been shown in some
              contexts to be achievable and economical. PTIDES
              is also robust to subsystem failures, and, perhaps
              most interestingly, provides a semantic basis for
              detecting such failures at the earliest possible
              time. },

              aspects and specifically timing and performance. A
              structured, compositional, model-based approach
              based on stepwise refinement and abstraction
              techniques can support the development process,

              of timed actors whose notion of refinement is
              based on the principle of worst-case design that
              permeates the world of performance-critical
              systems. This is in contrast with the classical
              behavioral and functional refinements based on
              restricting sets of behaviors. Our refinement
              allows time-deterministic abstractions to be made
              of time-non-deterministic systems, improving
              efficiency and reducing complexity of formal
              analysis. We show how our theory relates to, and

    abstract = {In a component-based design context, we propose a
              relational interface theory for synchronous
              systems. A component is abstracted by its
              interface, which consists of input and output
              variables, as well as one or more contracts. A
              contract is a relation between input and output
              assignments. In the stateless case, there is a
              single contract that holds at every synchronous
              round. In the general, stateful, case, the
              contract may depend on the state, modeled as the
              history of past observations. Interfaces can be
              composed by connection or feedback. Parallel
              composition is a special case of connection.
              Feedback is allowed only for Moore interfaces,
              where the contract does not depend on the current
              values of the input variables that are connected
              (although it may depend on past values of such
              variables). The theory includes explicit notions
              of environments, pluggability and
              substitutability. Environments are themselves
              interfaces. Pluggability means that the
              closed-loop system formed by an interface and an
              environment is well-formed, that is, a state with
              unsatisfiable contract is unreachable.
              Substitutability means that an interface can
              replace another interface in any environment. A
              refinement relation between interfaces is
              proposed, that has two main properties: first, it
              is preserved by composition; second, it is
              equivalent to substitutability for well-formed
              interfaces. Shared refinement and abstraction
              operators, corresponding to greatest lower and
              least upper bounds with respect to refinement, are
              also defined. Input-complete interfaces, that
              impose no restrictions on inputs, and
              deterministic interfaces, that produce a unique
              output for any legal input, are discussed as
              special cases, and an interesting duality between
              the two classes is exposed. A number of
              illustrative examples are provided, as well as
              algorithms to compute compositions, check
              refinement, and so on, for finite-state interfaces.},

              in an ISA without considering a particular
              hardware implementation of this ISA. <p>To enable
              reasoning about timing behavior of programs rather
              than programs on particular architectures, we
              propose to endow ISAs with timed semantics, and we
              introduce ISA extensions, so-called deadline
              instructions, which enable precise control over
              timing at the level of nanoseconds. Based on these
              deadline instructions, we propose higher-level
              timing constructs in C, which can in turn be used
              to implement timed models of computation, such as
              Giotto or PTIDES.},

              allowing designers to specify subgraphs of a

    abstract = {An increasing number of scientific workflows
              contain long running jobs but there has been
              little research on how to recover the workflow
              execution after the workflow execution engine
              itself failed. Most related work considers state
              within a fault tolerance framework where the
              workflow engine itself is not failing. Other
              approaches do not deal with stateful actors which
              can rarely be used in practice. We describe how to
              save and use internal state of actors for a
              recovery of a workflow execution engine from
              provenance information recorded up to the failure.
              We demonstrate in which degree the model of
              computation influences the recovery and we use the
              provenance currently recorded by other approaches
              such as the Kepler provenance recorder in order to
              resume a workflow execution. We show that while
              DAGMan workflows are easy to recover, SDF and PN
              directed workflows in Kepler are more complex to
              recover and offer more possibilities to optimize
              execution and recovery. In a serially scheduled
              SDF workflow at most one actor invocation can be
              effected by a workflow engine crash while in PN
              possibly all actors could be effected. We explore
              which models of provenance are suitable for a
              non-trivial (i.e., optimized) resume of a workflow
              execution and then present extended provenance
              models that are well suited for speeding up the
              workflow recovery in context of different models
              of computation. Modeling PN workflows using the
              iteration provided by the framework instead of a
              loop construct within the firing method could
              speed up workflow recovery dramatically. On the
              other hand the conventional read/write provenance
              model was found to insufficient for an efficient
              recovery of various models of computation because
              it lacks information about the internal state of
              actors. Our goal is to find more generic
              provenance models that offer a good performance
              for a restore as well as during execution and that
              will also be practical in a distributed workflow
              execution. We argue that concepts of global time
              and global unique IDs should be avoided wherever
              possible. Finally, we show how provenance queries
              are used to determine the status of a workflow
              execution as well as to extract important
              information that needs to be restored in order to
              do a resume. },

              complex data analysis pipelines. However,
              depending on the nature of the scientific
              workflow, interactive steps, i.e., which involve
              human analysis and decision making within the
              workflow are also common. So far, Kepler has had
              limited capabilities for letting users become
              "actors" in a scientific workflow. The
              Kepler/G-Pack (Google package) is a set of actors
              that leverage a simple form of cloud computing via
              Google-Apps and Google-Docs, effectively
              "outsourcing" Kepler tasks to Google resources.
              With this package, many tasks and steps that users
              would use the Google document and computational
              cloud for can now be orchestrated by Kepler
              programmatically. For example, via certain actors
              in this package, Google spreadsheets can be used
              as data sources, sinks, or computational steps
              ("transformers") in a Kepler workflow. Additional
              functionalities include: creating a new copy of a
              spreadsheet from a template, sharing a spreadsheet
              with another user, emailing the user to notify the
              sharing, provide feedback to the workflow that a
              human interactive session has finished
              ("committed") so the workflow instance may
              proceed, visualizing analysis outputs via Google
              charts etc. We will demonstrate the capabilities
              of the Kepler/G-Pack using different workflows,
              e.g., (1) a "Data Curation Workflow" in which
              biological specimen records are semi-automatically
              curated: The upstream part of the workflow groups
              records, identifying "curation work packages" that
              curators can validate or manually revise (this
              workflow shows the use of spreadsheets for data
              fusion and manual data cleaning within the
              workflow); (2) an "Evapotranspiration Workflow"
              which shows how Google spreadsheets can be used
              for remote computation and visualization.},

    abstract = {Data-intensive scientific workflows are
              traditionally modeled using a dataflow-oriented
              model. The simplicity of a dataflow model
              facilitates intuitive workflow design, analysis,
              and optimization. However, some amount of
              control-flow modeling is often necessary for
              engineering fault-tolerant, robust, and adaptive
              workflows. In scientific domains and cyber
              physical systems, myriads of environmental
              information are needed for the effective control
              of different stages of coordination and execution.
              Modeling various fine-grained controls using
              inherently dataflow-oriented actors will quickly
              result in a workflow that is hard to comprehend,
              reuse, and maintain. We present a context
              annotation framework for Kepler/Ptolemy that
              enables actors to exploit the dynamic
              environmental information during runtime without
              introducing complex control-flow actors or
              low-level re-coding of existing actors to cover
              all possible dynamic conditions. Contexts can
              refer to all data or events that can be sensed
              automatically from the physical environment. They
              can affect an actor's behavior but is not part of
              the original actor's design. Context should be
              modeled separately as an entity that can be read
              by any actor in many different ways, for example,
              via global parameters, an actor's ports, or an
              actor's parameters. To support the context
              annotation process, three key components are added
              to the existing Kepler/Ptolemy system: 1) context
              modeling and provisioning, 2) context binding, and
              3) context triggering. The incorporation of
              context-aware actors in a scientific workflow
              results in a scientific process that is aware of
              its environment during execution and that responds
              intelligently based on such awareness without
              having to hard-code or entangle complex
              reactionary logic in actors. A further advantage
              of annotating an actor with contexts is that the
              defined contexts can be reused and shared across
              other workflows via a model-driven design approach
              without writing any low level codes. Context
              annotation also hides the complexity of using
              complex workflows by providing high-level concepts
              for initializing and configuring multiple
              parameters that have implicit dependencies. This
              paper presents the motivation for and system
              design and implementation of a context annotation
