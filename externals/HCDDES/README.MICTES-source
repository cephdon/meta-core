WARNING: this document is outdated.

Unpack the MICTES-source.zip archive in a directory of your choosing.
You may also want the ANTLR.zip archive, as this contains a version of antlr
that was compiled under VS8(2005) and has both release and debug versions of
the antlr C++ run-time libraries (i.e. antlr.lib and antlrD.lib).

IF YOU DON'T HAVE antlrD.lib, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO COMPILE THE DEBUG VERSIONS
OF THE MICTES SOFTWARE

There is also a boost.zip archive that contains only the boost libraries
needed for MICTES (as well as *all* the header files).

Prerequisites for compile:
A) The BOOST library for windows XP.  This can be obtained from www.boost.org,
   or from the "boost.zip" file that can be obtained from ISIS.
B) The ANTLR library and jar files.  These can be obtained from www.anltr.org,
   or from the "antlr.zip" file that can be obtained from ISIS.
C) The latest GME distribution from ISIS.
D) The latest UDM distribution from ISIS - WITH THE XERCES HEADER FILES.
E) The latest GReAT distribution from ISIS.
F) Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 (or any package that contains the MSBuild.exe
   executable).
G) MATLAB 2006a or more recent version


Necessary Environment Variables:
UDM_PATH     This should already have been set by the UDM installation package,
             and should have a value that is the toplevel directory of your UDM
             installation (e.g. C:\Program Files\ISIS\UDM).

GREAT_PATH   This should already have been set by the GReAT installation
             package, and should have a value that is the toplevel directory
             of your GReAT installation (e.g. C:\Program Files\ISIS\GReAT).

ANTLR_PATH   Value should be the directory in your ANTLR installation that has
             the "include" and "lib" directories in it
             (e.g. C:\...\antlr\2.7.7).
             
ANTLR3_PATH  Value should be the directory with ANTLR 3.0.1 "include" and 
             "runtime" directories, needed while we are using both 2.7.7 and 
             3.0.1

BOOST_PATH   Value should be the toplevel directory of your Boost installation.

BOOST_VER    Value should be the name of the boost version directory in your
             boost installation BY ITSELF, i.e. it is NOT a path and thus
             SHOULD NOT contain any slashes (e.g. boost-1_33_1).

XERCES_PATH  Value should be the toplevel directory of your UDM installation's
             XERCES 3rdparty distribution.  This is typically
             %UDM_PATH%\3rdparty\xerces-c_2_5_0

MATLAB_PATH  Value should be the version-specific directory of your MATLAB
             installation (e.g. C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2006b).

To compile:
1) Change your directory to that with the VCP.sln file in it.  This file should
   be in the top level directory of the unzipped MICTES-source.zip file.

2) Type the following command:

<path-to-msbuild>\MSBUILD.exe /p:Configuration=[Release|Debug] VCP.sln

For instance, on my desktop machine, the command is:

C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\MSBuild.exe /p:Configuration=Release VCP.sln
