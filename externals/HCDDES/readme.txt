ESMoL requires GME and Udm, available from http://repo.isis.vanderbilt.edu/

Overview: 

The ESMoL tool chain is used to synthesize executable artifacts from abstract, graphical models of cyber-physical systems. Starting from idealized models of control systems imported from environments such as Simulink or BIP, ESMoL models are then embellished with models of the intended target platform(s). Finally a deployment model is created which maps the functional software components onto the actual available computational and communication resources. From these multi-dimensional models, the toolchain synthesizes hardware-agnostic functional code (e.g. C source code), legal time-triggered (TTA) schedules, and the glue code necessary to execute these artifacts within either a simulation environment (e.g. TrueTime) or on actual hardware (e.g. Gumstix Verdex embedded processors).
