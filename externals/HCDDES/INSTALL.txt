To build this crazy monster:

Dependencies
Matlab >= 2008a
UDM == 3.1.2
GReAT == 1.6.1
Java version compatible with ANTLR - Java 6 works
Libraries in the 3rdparty directory

VCP
First, set a number of environment variables as follows (use your own paths as appropriate):
set ANTLR_PATH=C:\src\3rdParty\antlr\2.7.7
set ANTLR3_PATH=c:\src\3rdParty\antlr\3.0.1
set BOOST_PATH=C:\src\3rdParty\boost-1_33_1
set MATLAB_PATH=C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2006a\
set XERCES_PATH=C:\Program Files\ISIS\UDM\3rdparty\xerces-c_2_5_0
set GECODE_PATH=c:\src\svn\HCDDES\3rdParty\gecode-2.2.0-bin
set CTEMPLATE_PATH=c:\src\svn\HCDDES\3rdParty\ctemplate-0.94-static
set VCP_PATH=c:\src\svn\HCDDES\trunk

Generally, these will point to the top-level of the installed library.

Open VCP.sln, choose Debug or Release, and invoke the build.  Binaries should
end up in bin/.

SchedTool
From Scheduler/SchedTool (and assuming the environment variables are set as above),
open SchedTool.sln.  The build should work from there.  Binaries will end up local to 
the SchedTool subdirectory.

TwoStage
From Proto_CodeGen/TwoStage/MetaAdapter, open the solution file.  Invoking the
build from the top should work.  Binaries end up local to the directory.
